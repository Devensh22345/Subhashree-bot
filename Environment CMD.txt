 Create a virtual environment using venv or virtualenv

Make sure venv is installed by running:

sudo apt install python3-venv

To create a new virtual environment in a directory named .venv, run:

python3 -m venv .venv

To activate this virtual environment (which modifies the PATH environment variable), run this:

source .venv/bin/activate

Now you can install a library like requests in this virtual environment:

pip install requests

The files will get installed under the .venv/ directory.

If you want to leave the virtual environment, you can run:

deactivate

If you don't want to run source .venv/bin/activate and deactivate, then you can run the executable by prefixing its path, like this:

 $ .venv/bin/pip install requests
 $ .venv/bin/python3
 >>> import request
 >>> help(requests)
